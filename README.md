# Anonymous Emailer

## What Is This

This is a repo for a conceptual anonymous emailer app. Each folder in the root
will contain the source code for each part of the stack -- backend through to front.

## Contributing
The only requirement is that each folder in the root is to contain it's own source code, 
build system, and Dockerfile.

Once a well-defined collection of projects is established, there may be a 
docker_compose.yaml file located in the root of this repo in order to build an orchestrated 
collection of Docker containers.
